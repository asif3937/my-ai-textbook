# Introduction to Humanoid Robotics

Humanoid robotics is a specialized field within robotics that focuses on creating robots with human-like characteristics and capabilities. These robots typically feature a head, torso, two arms, and two legs, though variations exist based on specific applications and design philosophies.

## What Defines a Humanoid Robot?

Humanoid robots are characterized by:
- **Anthropomorphic design**: Physical structure resembling humans
- **Bipedal locomotion**: Ability to walk on two legs
- **Human-like manipulation**: Arms and hands capable of human-like tasks
- **Social interaction capabilities**: Designed to interact with humans naturally

## Historical Development

The field of humanoid robotics has evolved significantly:

- **1960s-1970s**: Early mechanical walking machines
- **1980s-1990s**: Introduction of electronic control systems
- **2000s**: Advanced bipedal locomotion and basic interaction
- **2010s-Present**: Sophisticated AI integration and complex tasks

## Key Challenges

Humanoid robotics faces several significant challenges:

### Balance and Locomotion
- Maintaining stability during dynamic movements
- Walking on uneven terrain
- Recovery from disturbances
- Energy-efficient locomotion

### Manipulation
