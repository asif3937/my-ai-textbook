# Physical AI Basics

This chapter covers the fundamental concepts and building blocks of Physical AI systems.

## Core Components

Physical AI systems typically consist of several key components:

### Perception Systems
Perception systems enable robots to understand their environment through various sensors:
- Vision systems (cameras, LIDAR, depth sensors)
- Tactile sensors
- Auditory sensors
- Proprioceptive sensors (for self-awareness)

### Control Systems
Control systems determine how the robot acts based on its perceptions:
- Motion planning algorithms
- Feedback control loops
- Trajectory optimization

### Learning Systems
Learning systems enable adaptation and improvement:
- Reinforcement learning for control
- Imitation learning from demonstrations
- Transfer learning between tasks

## Mathematical Foundations

Physical AI relies on several mathematical frameworks:

### State Estimation
State estimation techniques help robots maintain awareness of their environment:
- Kalman filters
- Particle filters
- Bayesian inference

### Motion Planning
Motion planning algorithms compute safe and efficient paths:
- Sampling-based methods (RRT, PRM)
- Optimization-based methods
- Learning-based planning

### Control Theory
Control theory provides the foundation for robot movement:
- PID controllers
- Model Predictive Control (MPC)
- Adaptive control

## Simulation in Physical AI

Simulation plays a crucial role in Physical AI development:
- Physics engines like Bullet, MuJoCo, and PyBullet
