# AI-Native Textbook Platform

Welcome to the AI-Native Textbook with RAG Chatbot - an interactive learning platform focused on Physical AI and related topics. This platform combines comprehensive textbook content with an AI-powered chatbot that can answer questions based on the textbook material.

## 📚 About the Textbook

This textbook covers essential concepts of Physical AI through six comprehensive chapters:

1. **Introduction to Physical AI** - Foundational concepts, history, and key applications
2. **Basics of Humanoid Robotics** - Core principles of humanoid design, locomotion, manipulation, and sensing
3. **ROS 2 Fundamentals** - Introduction to Robot Operating System 2
4. **Digital Twin Simulation** - Concepts using Gazebo and NVIDIA Isaac Sim
5. **Vision-Language-Action Systems** - Integration of computer vision, NLP, and robotic action
6. **Capstone Project** - Integration of learned concepts in a comprehensive project

## 🤖 AI Chatbot

The platform features an integrated AI chatbot powered by Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) that can:
- Answer questions about the textbook content
- Provide explanations and clarifications
- Reference specific sections of the textbook
- Engage in interactive learning conversations
